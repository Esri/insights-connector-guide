# Welcome to the Insights connector guide!

Connectors are used to access data from databases directly in Insights. This guide provides resources to help you add connectors to use in your organization. You can download the sample files, read help documentation on the [Wiki page](https://github.com/ArcGIS/insights-connector-guide/wiki), or create an issue to ask a question.
