# Example Postgres SQL configuration files
This folder contains example of a database connection to Postgres Versions 8.2 - 9.4 which are not currently supported in ArcGIS insights-connector-guide/wiki/Create-a-connector-type-bundle
These configuration yaml files were tested using Postgres JDBC Driver https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download/postgresql-42.2.19.jar

> **Note**: The Properties file (properties.yml), SQL dialect file (dialect.yml), and the JDBC driver must be downloaded separately from the database vendorâ€™s website https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download/postgresql-42.2.19.jar. 
For more information, see [Create a connector type bundle](https://github.com/ArcGIS/insights-connector-guide/wiki/Create-a-connector-type-bundle) and [Manage connector types](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/insights/latest/administer/manage-connector-types.htm).
